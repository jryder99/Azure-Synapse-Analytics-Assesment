/*Causes of poor columnstore index quality
If you have identified tables with poor segment quality, you want to identify the root cause. Below are some other common causes of poor segment quality:

Memory pressure when index was built
High volume of DML operations
Small or trickle load operations
Too many partitions

 
Too many partitions
Another thing to consider is the impact of partitioning on your clustered columnstore tables. Before partitioning, SQL Data Warehouse already divides your data into 60 databases. Partitioning further divides your data. If you partition your data, then consider that each partition needs at least 1 million rows to benefit from a clustered columnstore index. If you partition your table into 100 partitions, then your table needs at least 6 billion rows to benefit from a clustered columnstore index (60 distributions 100 partitions 1 million rows). If your 100-partition table does not have 6 billion rows, either reduce the number of partitions or consider using a heap table instead.
